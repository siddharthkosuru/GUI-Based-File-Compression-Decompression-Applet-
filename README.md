# GUI-Based-File-Compression-Decompression-Applet-
Compression is the technique to minimize the size of data (or file) by applying some encoding algorithm. 
The output of the compression is called compressed or zipped data (or file). 
The main objective of this project is to design a compression software which significantly reduces the size of a file so that it can be easily shared over mail even in slow internet speed.
GZIP algorithm is base of this project which is basically developed through the usage of DEFLATE algorithm. 
The Domain “GZip” lets one to reduce the overall number of bits and bytes in a file so it can be transmitted faster over slower Internet connections or take up less space on a disk. 
The main algorithm is Huffman Algorithm for Compression/Decompression.
Huffman coding is an encoding algorithm for lossless data compression.
Huffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol,
    resulting in a prefix code that expresses the most common characters using shorter 
    strings of bits than are used for less common source symbols.
